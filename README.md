# color-reduction

This is my implementation for a distributed randomized coloring algorithm
for the assignment 3 bonus exercise from Design and Analysis of Algorithms, WS23.

## How to build

This project was created with [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) version 1.75.0.

1. Install Rust using [rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (recommended)
2. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/thomaslienbacher/color-reduction.git`
3. Run `cargo run --release` in the repository folder, this will build and run the project

The binary is placed in the `<repo>/target/release` folder and can alternatively 
be just build using `cargo build --release`.

## Previous version

It also included my implementation for assignment 2
exercise B in previous commits.
